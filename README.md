# CA3-WebDesign
This is a HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT group project created by @Christianne Pe√±a, @Patryck Brenner and @Vanessa Lyra.

The requirement for this project was to create a Business Website of our choice, we picked Tourism.

Into the folder CA3 you will find our project divided into 5 more folders and our 4 html pages. 
** Unfortunatlly GitHub does not accept videos, for this reason the folder "videos" which contains our videos could not be uploaded **


In our PROJECT REPORT you will find:
- The reason why we picked Tourism and the problems we faced;
- Who is our primary persona (interviews we done with friends and another group of students);
- How our site was designed (Wireframes and design patters per wireframe).
