# Make My Day Website

* This is a tourism website developed in group with only studies purposes. *
The website is divided in 4 HTML pages. The home page contains an introduction to the content, "about us" information and a "contact us" form which has its functionalities validates within a JAVASCRIPT file, whereas each of the other 3 pages contains information of a kind of trip our clients could possible choose (Adventure, Historical or Game of Thrones tour). All the content was styled by a unique CSS style sheet and as a purpose of testing the group knowledge, we also created a CSS style for each of our individual pages. I was responsible for coding the Adventure.html page, the JavaScript file and the main CSS style which ended up being the final Style for our page. 

In our PROJECT REPORT you will find:
- The reason why we picked Tourism and the problems we faced;
- Who is our primary persona (interviews we done with friends and another group of students);
- How our site was designed (Wireframes and design patters per wireframe).
